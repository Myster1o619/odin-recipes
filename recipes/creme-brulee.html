    <h3 class="recipe-description">Description</h3>
    <p>Creme brulee cooked in the slow cooker is an easy way to prepare this creamy dessert and you only need 5 simple
        ingredients. These can be baked and chilled 2 days ahead. Cover ramekins after chilling 3 hours to prevent
        condensation on the surface of the custards.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk yolks with 1/4 cup sugar and salt in a bowl until smooth; gently whisk in cream and vanilla extract.
            Strain custard mixture into a liquid measuring cup.

        </li>
        <li>Line bottom of a 6-quart oval slow cooker with a folded kitchen towel to create a level surface so ramekins
            won't slide around. Set four 4-ounce ramekins on the towel. Fill slow cooker with enough water to come
            halfway up sides of ramekins.</li>
        <li>Pour custard evenly into ramekins. Drape paper towels over top of slow cooker liner to absorb any
            condensation during baking; cover with lid to secure.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low until custard is set but jiggles slightly, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer ramekins to a rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Refrigerate custards, uncovered, until
            cold, at least 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over each ramekin and shake gently to distribute evenly. Heat the sugar using a
            culinary torch until melted and browned, about 1 minute.</li>
    </ol>
